Let  be the set of pairs of real numbers . Let .

Consider the function  from  to  defined by , and its -th iterated composition . For example . A pair  is said to have period  if  is the smallest positive integer such that .

Let  denote the sum of -coordinates of all points having period not exceeding . Interestingly,  is always an integer. For example, , , .

Find  and give your answer modulo .
